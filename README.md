**Summary: Full Stack Task Management System**

**Purpose and Use Case**

* Simplifies personal or team task tracking with CRUD functionality
* Offers user authentication for personalized task management
* Supports real-time updates through frontend-backend communication
* Suitable for individual productivity or team coordination tools

**Key Differences and Strengths**

* Full stack architecture enables real data persistence with MySQL database
* User-based task handling sets it apart from basic to-do list apps
* Uses real API endpoints and database integration rather than static localStorage
* Scalable structure that allows addition of features like reminders, tags, or analytics

**Technologies Used**

Frontend

* React.js for building interactive UI components
* React Router for navigation
* Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests
* CSS for styling and layout

Backend

* Node.js with Express.js for REST API development
* MySQL for relational database management
* dotenv for secure configuration
* CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests

Others

* GitHub for version control and collaboration
* Postman for API testing and debugging

**Future Scope and Extensions**

* Add JWT-based authentication for secure session handling
* Implement task priorities, due dates, and reminders
* Integrate drag-and-drop task ordering with real-time updates
* Add charts or dashboards to visualize task progress
* Create a mobile app using React Native with the same backend
* Enable team collaboration with role-based access control
* Use cloud database and deploy backend on Render or Railway for production use
